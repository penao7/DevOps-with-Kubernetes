# Rancher versus OpenShift

- Rancher installation is a lot faster, some OpenShift installations have been reported to have taken weeks

- Rancher is totally free but for OpenShift only community version is free

- Rancher version upgrades are reported to be smoother than in OpenShift

- In Rancher Multi-Cluster has been available for many years

- Rancher is 100% Open Source but OpenShift is only partly open source

- Rancher uses newer Kubernetes version than OpenShift

- Rancher Management and Kubernetes are decoupled, switching to vanilla Kubernetes is possible. In OpenShift this is not possible
